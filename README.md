I have broken up the landing page into 3 main sections:

1. ### Header - background colour #1F2937

   - [x] logo
     - an icon maybe from flaticon \* <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/user" title="user icons">User icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</a>
   - [x] nav bar with hyperlinks
         -- change <a> tag colors
   - [x] position nav bar to the right
   - [x] 50% width quick intro with sign up button, 50% width image on the side

2. ### Body

     - [x] liverpool fc
     - [x] watching sports
     - [x] reading
